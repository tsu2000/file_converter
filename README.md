# file_converter

A simple file conversion web application that allows users to convert (for now):

- `.pdf` files to `.xlsx` files
- `.txt` files to `.csv` files
- `.csv` files to `.json` files

Any suggestion for different types of file conversions (that are widely used) is welcome.

**Known limitations:**
- Modules used may not be up-to-date, resulting in conversion errors.
- Individual file size for `st.file_uploader` is limited to a maximum of **200MB**
